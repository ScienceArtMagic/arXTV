# hvr
full-stack hono + vite + react template w/ bun

why?
it's fast lol, no nextjs slop

## setup, run, build, deploy
install:
```
bun install
```

run:
```
bun dev
```	
this spins up two terminal processes, one for the frontend and one for the server.

build & deploy:
```
bun run build
bun run start
```


**notes**
using concurrently cuz bun `&&` doesn't work on windows yet
